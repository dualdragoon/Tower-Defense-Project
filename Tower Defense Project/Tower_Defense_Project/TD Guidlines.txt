Short Term:


Long Term:

	Gamemode Type: open field where towers are placed freely and enemies use path finding to get to the end.

	Game Type: Survival mode with endless waves of enemies.

	Use custom solar system.
		-have individual planets have unique features that affect gameplay in interesting ways.

	Alternate way to play campagin - Modular.
		-you are given 3-5 basic towers to start the game with average stats and costs to begin with, after completeing levels or challenges you receive components for crafting parts for your towers which affect their stats, costs, and appearance.



Mutagens:

	Zero gravity environments in a psuedo-3D space.

	World/Zone-based events that can affect any number of things.



Planets:
	
	Crystal covered/infested planet akin to smaller scale versions of the common form of superman's fortress of solitude.
		for infected - the planet has some sort of atmospheric destabilization that allows in more of one wavelength of light than others allowing for strange and wonderous evolution to occur.

	Ancient deserted city-planet full of the desiccated bodies of a forgotten race as if they all died at once to an unknown threat (possibly an explorative planet for loot or lore elements or some such).




Side-Side-Side Idea:

	Rather than a linear story, have it be open ended with you being sort of a mercenary leader that takes on randomly generated tasks themed toward the environment.
